    <section id="abstract">
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>This project explores Apache Pig, a powerful tool in the big data ecosystem built on top of Hadoop. It simplifies the process of analyzing large datasets using Pig Latin, a high-level scripting language. We investigate Pig's architecture, scripting capabilities, and real-world use cases, evaluating its performance, scalability, and benefits over traditional MapReduce methods.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="objectives">
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop a deep understanding of Apache Pig's architecture and core components</li>
        <li>Achieve proficiency in writing and optimizing Pig Latin scripts</li>
        <li>Evaluate Apache Pig's performance and scalability across datasets</li>
        <li>Identify real-world applications where Apache Pig excels</li>
        <li>Provide strategic recommendations for integrating Pig into big data workflows</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="methodology">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>We conducted a literature review, performed benchmarking on datasets of various types, and analyzed case studies from industry. Testing included metrics such as execution time, CPU usage, and fault tolerance. Use cases were also reviewed to provide a well-rounded evaluation of Pig's utility.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="results">
      <h2>Expected Results</h2>
      <p>We expect Apache Pig to outperform traditional methods in development speed and efficiency, especially with semi-structured and unstructured data. Case studies will support Pigâ€™s use in real-world scenarios, and our benchmarks will show strong scalability and resource management capabilities.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="recommendations">
      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adopt Pig in scenarios requiring fast development cycles and complex transformations</li>
        <li>Provide team training in Pig Latin and the Hadoop ecosystem</li>
        <li>Use Pig for semi-structured/unstructured data workflows</li>
        <li>Optimize scripts and resource management for best performance</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Apache Pig presents a compelling alternative to traditional MapReduce jobs. Its high-level abstraction allows for faster development while maintaining strong performance and scalability. It enables a broader range of professionals to work with big data effectively and will remain relevant in modern data analytics environments.</p>
